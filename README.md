# Multiprocessing and Multithreading in C++ 
This repository contains laboratory works on the subject "Operating systems".
1. **OS_1** — a simple multiprocessing, where 2 process are created and run alternately in Main.cpp. For more details click [here](https://github.com/AlexanderYurevich/Operating_systems/tree/main/OS_1)
2. **OS_2** — a simple multithreading project, where 2 threads are created and read shared memory. For more details click [here](https://github.com/AlexanderYurevich/Operating_systems/tree/main/OS_2)
3. **OS_3** — a multithreading project, where Critical section is used for synchronizing access to shared memory. For more details click [here](https://github.com/AlexanderYurevich/Operating_systems/tree/main/OS_3)
4. **OS_4** — a multiprocessing, where processes send messages via shared file. For more details click [here](https://github.com/AlexanderYurevich/Operating_systems/tree/main/OS_4)
5. **OS_5** — a multiprocessing, where processes take access too shared file through named channels. For more details click [here](https://github.com/AlexanderYurevich/Operating_systems/tree/main/OS_5)
